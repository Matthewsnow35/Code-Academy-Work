// This activity in codeacademy went over comparison operators, how their used in conditional statements, syntax etc. This activity
// had me incorparate what I learned into an if...else statement. Below are the instructions that were provided to me.
// Instructions:
// 1. Using let, create a variable named hungerLevel and set it equal to 7.

// Checkpoint 2 Passed

// 2. Write an if...else statement using a comparison operator. The condition should check if hungerLevel is greater than 7. If so, the conditional statement should log, 'Time to eat!'. Otherwise, it should log 'We can eat later!'.

// After you press run, play around with the condition by tweaking the comparison of hungerLevel by using different operators such as <=,>=,>, and <.
