// In this activity I learned that a ternary operator can be used to simplify an if...else statement by basically shortening it
// with better syntax. Then in the actvity itself i was tasked with taking elongated if...else statements and using ternary operators for
// better syntax

// Actvity Instructions:

// 1.) Refactor, or edit, the first if...else block to use a ternary operator.
// 2.) Refactor the second if...else block to use a ternary operator.
// 3.) Refactor the third if...else block to use a ternary operator.
