// In this activity I worked with the concept of Truthy and Falsy and how they relate to conditional statements. I learned 
// how these concepts are used in if...else statements depending on the truthy or falsy value and how they trigger the if statements or the else statements.
// Also learned defintions of turthy and falsy values. 
// Lastly I did an actvity that involved changing the value of a variable so it is "truthy" and triggers the "if" statement. Then I changed the value of
// another variable so that it was still a string but had a "falsy" value so the else statement was triggered

// Instructions for Actvity as follows:

// 1.) Change the value of wordCount so that it is truthy. This value should still be a number.
// After you make this change and run your code, 'Great! You've started your work!' should log to the console.

// 2.) Change the value of favoritePhrase so that it is still a string but falsy.
// After you make this change and run your code, 'This string is definitely empty.' should log to the console.
