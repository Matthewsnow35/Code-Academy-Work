# In this activity I learned about String Concatenation in Python. I learned that string concatenation is when two or more strings are combined. 
# Performing string concatenation creates a brand new string comprised of the first string’s contents followed by the second string’s contents.
# I also learned how to concatenate a string with a number, thats done by making number a string first, then using the str() function.

# In the activity I was tasked with taking the strings provided, concatenate them into a variable and printing them to the console

# ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS: 
# 1.) Concatenate the strings and save the message they form in the variable message.

# 2.) Now uncomment the print statement and run your code to see the result in the terminal!
